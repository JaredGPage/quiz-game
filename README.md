Quiz-Game:
- Jared Page

This applications purpose is for a user to select an avatar and an accessory, which in this application relates to a boarder for the user.
The user then can start a questionaire and is score on how fast they can answer the questions.

To comment on topics mentioned:
Security:
Including secure authentication methods, input validation (not too topical for the quiz), and encryption of sensitive data
- The input validation and encryption of data can come in hand with regards to an enhancement to this project for users to be able to login and have that information stored.

Validation:
Validation ensure the correct input is used which would correslate to specified criteria. This helps prevent errros and improves the UI experience.
- An example with an enhancement would be to validate user credentials such as email, mobile, and password. 

Tests:
This relates to ensuring the application works as expected. This would include unit tests and end-to-end tests.
- During testing of this application I realised if the user took too long to answer the question the score would go into negatives, even if they answered correctly. This enforced a check to see if the value had gone into negative and amend the score.

Progressive Enhancement:
So with the quiz game, enhacements can be added for the login process, saving of questionaire results and data analysis on those results.
- An example could be that through data analysis, the identification of a common misconception on how to handle a situation can be identified and steps can be put into place to address users misconception of a topic.

Caching:
This relates to the storing of frequesntly used data or resources to reduce loading times.
- An example of this could relate to the caching of the users avatar and accessory, especially if it is displayed often.

Responsive Design:
Responsive design enhances the user experience and can make use of the application more intutive. Content on the screen can also adapt depending on the users screen size or device.
- This concept would also entail that a constant UX is provided over all platforms

Accessibility:
This I would say refers to taking into mind on the audience of the application and how they will access the application.
- Quesions to ask could be if any of the users have a disability that would prevent them from using it, is the audience able to understand and comprehend questions in the questionaire.
